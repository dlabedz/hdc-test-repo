# HDC Test Project

Welcome to the repo for my HDC test project! 

## Description

This repo contains the theme files, uploads folder, database dump, and plugins used/created to complete this project. 

## Notes

This project uses the [Tailpress](https://tailpress.io/) base theme.

For block animations, I used the [Block Animations plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocks-animation/) to save time and try it out in a test environment. 

I've included a SQL file with my up to date database from my local environment. 

I used mostly core blocks and only created one custom block, the hero slider. You'll see this in the Plugins directory. 

For the slider library, I used [SwiperJS](https://swiperjs.com/). 

I did not end up using ACF at all to construct the blocks, and I did so to try to take advantage of as many native block features as possible. 

I created two block patterns for the overlapping images, and those are saved in the database. 

I created custom block styles for a Primary and Secondary button to make using the Buttons block a more seamless user expderience.
